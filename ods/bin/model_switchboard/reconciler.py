"""Runtime activation sequence for the ODS Model Switchboard (PR 2A).

One orchestration of the runtime phase of a model swap:

    stage -> verify_identity -> verify_completion

The reconciler owns sequencing and failure classification only. Snapshots,
consumer projection, HTTP contracts, and rollback proof remain with the host
agent's activation transaction until later slices migrate them. A phase
failure stops the sequence immediately and reports which boundary failed so
the caller's existing rollback machinery takes over.
